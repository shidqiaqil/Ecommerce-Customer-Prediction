# Ecommerce Customer Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer behavior in an e-commerce platform using linear regression techniques. The analysis utilizes the Ecommerce Customer dataset, which includes a variety of customer information, such as email, address, color avatar, and essential numerical features like average session length, time spent on the app and website, and the length of membership.

## Dataset

The Ecommerce Customer dataset is a comprehensive collection of customer-centric data, providing valuable insights into user preferences and engagement. Noteworthy numerical features include:
- **Avg. Session Length:** Average duration of in-store style advice sessions.
- **Time on App:** Average time spent on the mobile application in minutes.
- **Time on Website:** Average time spent on the website in minutes.
- **Length of Membership:** Number of years the customer has been a member.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Thorough analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare it for analysis.
- **Linear Regression Model:** Building and training a linear regression model to predict customer behavior based on the provided features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using relevant metrics and refining it for optimal accuracy.

## Results

The primary objective is to deliver a robust linear regression model capable of predicting customer behavior accurately. This predictive capability offers valuable insights for marketing strategies, business decisions, and user experience enhancements.
